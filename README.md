# 3D_Asteroids
A small prototype based on the classic game about surviving and avoiding asteroids as a spaceship, but in 3D! Made with Unreal Engine 4. (The only graphical element i made myself is the swirling "wormhole" material, the asteroid and projectile particle systems are from plugins and the spaceship is from a UE4 template project).
